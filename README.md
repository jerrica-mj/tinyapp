# TinyApp Project
TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

TinyApp lets users register with an email to:
- Create new shortened URLs;
- See all shortened URLs on their account;
- Update the long URL for their shortened URLs; and
- Delete any of their shortened URLs.
